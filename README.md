# Auto-Connection-VPN-for-Campus-WiFi-Service

Environment: Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) & C++

A VPN with functions of automatic connection, reconnection when losing and disconnection to my campus Wi-Fi service.


Developed a plug-in that automatically prompted the user to connect to campus network once a web browser was opened but the network not available, and automatically disconnected the network when the plug-in was quitted.

Realized the function of remembering network connection username and password and automatically connecting to the network without inputting log-in information for a second time.

Realized the function of re-connecting to the network automatically after detecting network disconnection.
